T.C.P is a web-based application that aims to bring your team’s work together in one shared space, allowing people to collaborate no matter where you are. The main focus is to organize and assign tasks. With this structure, teams can immediately see what they need to do, which tasks are assigned by the leader, and when work is due. The application ensures that there is no wastage of time on tedious manual tasks. This Automation aids in simplifying workflows, reducing errors, and saving time for solving more important problems.
